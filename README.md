# Fluke 9010a Checksum Tool

This is a Python rewrite of Brian Bâ€™s Perl Fluke 9010a checksum tool,
which in turn was reverse engineered from QuarterArcades "calcsig,"
which was itself the product of reverse engineering the Fluke tools.

# Usage

The program accepts no options. Each argument is the name of a file to
checksum.

```
$ ./flukesig.py tempest/*
