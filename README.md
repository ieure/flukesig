# Fluke 9010a Checksum Tool

This is a Python rewrite of Brian Bâ€™s Perl Fluke 9010a checksum tool,
which in turn was reverse engineered from QuarterArcades "calcsig,"
which was itself the product of reverse engineering the Fluke tools.

# Fluke 9010a?

The Fluke 9010a is an old tool for troubleshooting microprocessor
based systems. It can calculate the checksum of parts of the address
space, for example, to verify ROM contents.
